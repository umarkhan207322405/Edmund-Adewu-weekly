### Project Installation and Issue Inspection
__3/12/2020__: I resumed setting up the development environment. After navigating to the proper subfolder, I ran the command `yarn run bootstrap` in order to install the required dependencies. The process took apprximately 13 minutes to complete. 

Running the `yarn test` command proved to be successful. All 245 test suites passed. Of the 2415 tests, 2376 passed, 30 were skipped, and 9 were marked as todo. All 827 snapshots passed. The entire process took roughly 2 minutes to complete.

The following issues are of interest to me:
* [#21751](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21751)
* [#21569](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21569)
* [#21590](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21590)

The aforementioned issues are varied enough to enable me to learn different aspects of the Gatsby project. In addition, there is enough activity present to warrant a decent response time and enough detail to figure out where to start. These issues are merely an introduction to the real-world open source contribution process. My contributions won't necessarily end with these issues.

### [Open Source is Not About You](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9)
Having read the aforementioned article, I have to say that the author makes some valid points. Just because a creator makes some of their works available to the public doesn't mean that they are obligated to put their life on hold to maintain the project. The creator has other needs or desires to tend to. After all, __they are only human.__ Besides, it isn't as if they will live forever, which is why, in the case of open source projects, they take the time to leave contribution instructions available to the public. 

Still, writing every potential contributor off as wrong in their complaints does no one any good. Legitimate, well-formatted inquiries
about a project can help improve it by pinpointing potential flaws or encouraging contributors to research the knowledge necessary
to make the desired adjustments. Such inquiries exist, but are often hidden amongst the ramblings of the naysayers. When something is free, people assume it will be easy to access, thus not appreciating how much work went into making the product. As a result, when 
something goes wrong or the product lacks a nonessential feature they desire, some users act not unlike mites, nipping at maintainers until something gives way, either their own interest in the product or the maintainer's patience.

Strong sentiment aside, my point is that regardless of form, open source contributions should be done primarily out of interest or need (i.e. skill development, exploring new technologies, task fulfillment, etc.). Charity is, at best, rather unpredictable. 

### Wikipedia
Wikipedia is a gargantuan repository of topics. The [Contributing to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia#Getting_started) page could really use the [Simple English](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) treatment, especially if they didn't want to intimidate newcomers. In order to expedite the editing process, I decided to prioritise article [stubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Stub_types). The page seems like a good starting point since it clearly lists articles in need of expansion. While I will need to search for other categories of edits at a later point, the following
articles caught my attention:

* [Joker Stairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_Stairs): I happen to live next to the attraction. I might consider editing the picture. Much of the Joker-related grafitti was cleaned up. The only indicators present are an 8-bit Joker cutout and faint Joker-themed writing at the base of the stairs.

* [Boa Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boa_knot): The assembly process leaves much to be desired. In addition, there aren't very many inline citations.
